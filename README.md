This repo will be used to complete the week 5 bootcamp challenge - Password Generator

## Description 
The purpose of this challenge was to utilise the skills we learned in this weeks bootcamp by creating a password generator app from using Javscript following a set of acceptance criteria.

The motivation for this project was to take all the key learning in the fifth week of lessons and put them to use in a real world scenario by building a password generator app that will be shared on my digital CV.

The project was built to consolidate knowledge and usage of Javscript best practices. It was also used to design a completed app, with numerous prompts, and validations.

This project solves key problems such as making the App function in a way that takes in user inputs and provides a secure password for them to use.

Key learnings: 

1. Using Javscript functions, Objects and Arrays
2. How to use basic git commands such as add, commit and push to save changes in a repository such as Github
3. Use event listeners to make something happen when a button is clicked by a user
4. Validation rules
5. Utilise special characters 

## Acceptance Criteria

Here is a list of criteria that has to be met to pass the challenge: 
Your application must:

Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password:

At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

Character types:

Lowercase

Uppercase

Numeric

Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
